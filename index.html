      <p>With the amount of
       information available on the web, finding what you need would be 
       nearly impossible without some help sorting through it. Google 
       ranking systems are designed to do just that: sort through hundreds
        of billions of webpages in our Search index to find the most 
        relevant, useful results in a fraction of a second, and present 
        them in a way that helps you find what you’re looking for.
      </p>
        
      <p>
      These ranking systems are made up of not one, but a whole
       series of algorithms. To give you the most useful information, 
       Search algorithms look at many factors, including the words of your
        query, relevance and usability of pages, expertise of sources,
         and your location and settings. The weight applied to each factor
          varies depending on the nature of your query—for example, the 
          freshness of the content plays a bigger role in answering 
          queries about current news topics than it does about dictionary
           definitions.</p>
           <p>
      To help ensure Search algorithms meet high standards of relevance 
      and quality, we have a rigorous process that involves both live 
      tests and thousands of trained external Search Quality Raters from 
      around the world. These Quality Raters follow strict guidelines that
       define our goals for Search algorithms and are publicly available
        for anyone to see.</p>
